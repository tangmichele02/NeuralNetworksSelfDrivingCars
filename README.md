We decided to use an open-source car simulator to focus only on the machine learning portion of the self-driving car development. And the most common form of machine learning algorithms used in autonomous cars is neural networks. Four of the most common deep learning methods used in the development of self-driving cars are convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, auto-encoders, and deep reinforcement learning[^1]. The problems the models need to solve include obstacle detection, scene classification and understanding, lane recognition, path planning, motion control, and traffic signs and lights recognition[^1]. Previous research has put emphasis on safety by developing models capable of dealing with bad drivers of other cars, right of way laws, unstructured roads, pedestrians, and responsibility for actions[^2].
